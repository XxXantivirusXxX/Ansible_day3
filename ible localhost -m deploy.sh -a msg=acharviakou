> GROUP    (/home/student/.pyenv/versions/3.7.1/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/system/group.py)

        Manage presence of groups on a host. For Windows targets, use
        the [win_group] module instead.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- gid
        Optional `GID' to set for the group.
        [Default: (null)]

- local
        Forces the use of "local" command alternatives on platforms
        that implement it. This is useful in environments that use
        centralized authentification when you want to manipulate the
        local groups. I.E. it uses `lgroupadd` instead of `useradd`.
        This requires that these commands exist on the targeted host,
        otherwise it will be a fatal error.
        [Default: no]
        version_added: 2.6

= name
        Name of the group to manage.


- state
        Whether the group should be present or not on the remote host.
        (Choices: absent, present)[Default: present]

- system
        If `yes', indicates that the group created is a system group.
        [Default: no]
        type: bool


NOTES:
      * For Windows targets, use the [win_group] module instead.
